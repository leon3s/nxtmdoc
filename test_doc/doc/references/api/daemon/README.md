## Develop with Nanocl Daemon API

Nanocl provides an API for interacting with the Nanocl daemon (called the Nanocl
Engine API), as well as SDKs for Go and Python. The SDKs allow you to build and
scale Nanocl apps and solutions quickly and easily. If Go or Python don't work
for you, you can use the Nanocl Engine API directly.

For information about Nanocl Engine SDKs, see [Develop with Nanocl Engine SDKs](/engine/api/sdk/).

The Nanocl Engine API is a RESTful API accessed by an HTTP client such as `wget` or
`curl`, or the HTTP library which is part of most modern programming languages.
