## Motivation

Where `docusaurus` is a thing today and mostly used.
I wanted to experience to make my own.
It's follow better markdown compatibility with `Github`.
So documentation can be both readable in `Github` and on the `Website`.

## How to use it?

```bash
  npm install && npm run dev ./test_doc
```

See the `Dockerfile` for production

You can have an example of configuration on this [repository](https://github.com/nxthat/documentation)
And an example of a deployed version on this url [docs.next-hat.com](https://docs.next-hat.com)
