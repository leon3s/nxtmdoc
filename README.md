Next Markdown Documentation

This project turn you markdown into website.

## Motivation

Where `docusaurus` is a thing today and mostly used.
I wanted to experience to make my own.
It's follow better markdown compatibility with github
So documentation can be both readable in github or on the website

```bash
  npm install && npm run dev ./test_doc
```
